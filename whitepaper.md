## Executive Summary

Book of Scams is a decentralized criminal registry bringing accountability and justice to the Wild West of crypto. By leveraging blockchain technology, we've created a platform where the community can document, track, and report crypto scammers, bringing transparency to an often opaque environment.

Our platform combines the immutability of blockchain records with a community-driven approach to create a comprehensive database of known scammers, their methods, and the evidence against them. This provides the crypto community with a powerful tool to protect themselves and others from fraudulent actors.

## The Problem

The cryptocurrency space has seen explosive growth, but with this expansion comes an increased risk of scams and fraudulent activities. Current challenges include:

- **Lack of Accountability**: Traditional financial systems have established methods for identifying and preventing fraud. The cryptocurrency space lacks these safeguards.
- **Anonymity**: The pseudo-anonymous nature of blockchain makes it difficult to identify scammers.
- **Limited Recourse**: Once crypto assets are stolen, recovery is nearly impossible.
- **Information Silos**: Reports of scams are scattered across various platforms, making it difficult to verify patterns or history.
- **Rapid Evolution**: Scammers continuously adapt their techniques, making it hard for the community to stay informed.

According to industry reports, crypto scams resulted in over $14 billion in losses in 2021 alone, with this figure continually rising.

## The Solution

Book of Scams provides a decentralized platform that addresses these challenges through:

1. **Transparent Registry**: An immutable, blockchain-based registry of confirmed scammers, their aliases, and methodologies.
2. **Community Verification**: A system that allows the community to contribute evidence, vote on listings, and maintain the integrity of the registry.
3. **Early Warning System**: Real-time alerts and notifications about emerging scams and actors.
4. **Education Hub**: Resources to help users identify potential scams before they become victims.
5. **Bounty System**: Financial incentives to encourage the reporting and documentation of scammers.

Our western-themed interface makes the platform approachable while providing powerful tools for documentation and verification.

## Technical Architecture

Book of Scams is built on a hybrid architecture that combines the benefits of decentralized blockchain technology with scalable web technologies.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API and local state management
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **UI/UX**: Western-themed interface with responsive design principles

### Backend
- **Database**: Supabase for relational data storage
- **Authentication**: Wallet-based authentication using Phantom (Solana)
- **Storage**: Decentralized storage for evidence and documentation
- **API Layer**: RESTful APIs for data interaction

### Blockchain Integration
- **Primary Chain**: Solana for fast, low-cost transactions
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom contracts for:
  - Scammer registry management
  - BOSC token functionality
  - Bounty distribution
  - Verification processes

### Smart Contract Architecture

The core of Book of Scams is built on two primary smart contracts:

#### BOSC Token Contract
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract BOSCToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("Book of Scams", "BOSC") Ownable(msg.sender) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
    
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

#### Book of Scams Registry Contract
Our main contract handles the scammer registry and bounty functionality, securely storing data on-chain while integrating with off-chain resources:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract BookOfScams {
    struct Scammer {
        string name;
        string accusedOf;
        string photoUrl;
        uint256 bountyAmount;
        address reporter;
        uint256 dateAdded;
        bool exists;
    }
    
    // Mapping from scammer ID to Scammer struct
    mapping(bytes32 => Scammer) public scammers;
    
    // Array to keep track of all scammer IDs
    bytes32[] public scammerIds;
    
    // Events
    event ScammerAdded(bytes32 indexed scammerId, string name, address reporter, uint256 bountyAmount);
    event BountyIncreased(bytes32 indexed scammerId, uint256 amount, uint256 newTotal, address contributor);
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Authentication**: Login via wallet (Phantom)
2. **Data Submission**: Scammer information and evidence submitted through UI
3. **Verification**: Community verification process
4. **Storage**: Data stored on Supabase with blockchain references
5. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Bounty distribution and registry updates
